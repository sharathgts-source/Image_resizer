# Image_resizer

The Image Resizer Tool is a Python-based utility designed to automate the process of resizing and converting images in bulk. This script scans a specified folder, resizes each image to user-defined dimensions, and optionally converts them to a consistent format (e.g., from PNG to JPEG). It uses the Pillow library (PIL fork) for image manipulation and Python's built-in os module to handle file operations.

This tool is ideal for developers, designers, and content creators who frequently work with large sets of images and need a fast, automated way to standardize image dimensions and formats for web or application use.
